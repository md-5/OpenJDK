 * example, if you annotate a class to suppress one warning and annotate a
 * method to suppress another, both warnings will be suppressed in the method.
 *
 * <p>As a matter of style, programmers should always use this annotation
 * on the most deeply nested element where it is effective.  If you want to
 * suppress a warning in a particular method, you should annotate that
 * method rather than its class.
